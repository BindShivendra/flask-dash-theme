- In single-script applications, the application instance exists in the global scope, 
    so routes can be easily defined using the app.route decorator. But now that the 
    application is created at runtime, the app.route decorator begins 
    to exist only after create_app() is invoked, which is too late. Custom error page 
    handlers present the same problem, as these are defined with the app.errorhandler 
    decorator. 

-  A blueprint is similar to an application in that it can also define routes and error 
    handlers. The difference is that when these are defined in a blueprint they are in a 
    dormant state until the blueprint is registered with an application, at which point 
    they become part of it. Using a blueprint defined in the global scope, the routes and 
    error handlers of the application can be defined in almost the same way as in the single-script 
    application
